## 🛍️ Product Filtering UI – Clean & Functional Filtering Component ##
 > Built as a frontend practice project to learn search logic, category-based filtering, and responsive UI — using pure HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

 ** This is not just a UI layout — it’s a working product filter built for real usage.
Users can search products by name and narrow down results by category — fully responsive and dependency-free.**

 ## ✨ Features Implemented ##
🔍 Name Search
Live search through product names

Case-insensitive filtering with instant results

🗂️ Category Filter
Dropdown-based filtering by product categories

Works seamlessly with search input

📱 Responsive Design
Tailwind CSS layout adapts to all screen sizes

Mobile-first, fully responsive

## 🚀 Tech Stack ##
⚙️ HTML5 – semantic structure

🎨 Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling

🧠 JavaScript (ES6) – filter/search logic



# No setup required ###

Everything runs on the front-end. Just plug and play.

🧠 How It Works
data.js → contains product data (name + category)

script.js → handles search & filter logic

index.html → basic UI markup

TailwindCSS CDN → used for styling, no build tools needed



## 🛠️ Customization ##
You can:

Add more filters (price, rating, etc.)

Replace Tailwind with your own styles

Extend logic in script.js

Want to go further? Turn it into a component or integrate into your product catalog.
