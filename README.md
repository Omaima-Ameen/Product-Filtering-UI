🛍️ Product Filtering UI
A lightweight, responsive product filtering UI built using Vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. Allows users to search products by name and filter by category — minimal yet powerful for modern frontend needs.

✨ Features
🔍 Name-based search

🗂️ Category filter

📱 Fully responsive layout using Tailwind

⚡ No dependencies — plain JavaScript only

🧠 Easy to integrate into any static or dynamic project

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-filter-ui.git
Open index.html directly in your browser:

bash
Copy
Edit
# No setup required
Everything runs on the front-end. Just plug and play.

🧠 How It Works
data.js → contains product data (name + category)

script.js → handles search & filter logic

index.html → basic UI markup

TailwindCSS CDN → used for styling, no build tools needed

Just don’t sell it as-is and we’re cool 😎

Bhai bas ye file README.md bana ke daal repo me, and it’ll feel like a pro project.
Bole toh — neat, styled, and good enough to show off in interviews.

Kuch aur chahiye? Deployment guide, filter demo code, ya dark mode toggle bhi likhwa le.
